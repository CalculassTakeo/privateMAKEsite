I’m a PhD student in [computer science](https://cs.au.dk/) at [Aarhus University](https://international.au.dk/), under the supervison of [Davide Mottin](https://mott.in/) and [Panagiotis Karras](https://cs.au.dk/~karras/). My research revolves around knowledge graphs, data mining, and data quality, with a particular focus on making them more reliable and robust. I completed my BSc in computer science at the University of Vienna before moving to Denmark for my MSc.

When I’m not engaged with the PhD life, you’ll likely find me reading a good book, strategizing over board games, climbing, or ballroom dancing. And no matter how busy life gets, there’s always time for LEGO!

## Research Interests

### Knowledge Graphs

Knowledge graphs are heterogeneous networks of interconnected entities (nodes) and relationships (edges), representing real-world objects or abstract concepts. Each connection, known as a triple, captures a fact linking two entities through a specific relation. E.g., the triple ("Leonardo da Vinci", "painted", "Mona Lisa") would describe the fact that Leonardo da Vinci was the artist that painted the Mona Lisa.

One of the goals of my past and ongoing projects is to investigate whether the reliability of a particular subgraph within a knowledge graph can be evaluated across multiple applications before their execution.

### Data Mining

Data mining is the process of discovering patterns, relationships, and useful insights from large datasets using techniques from statistics, machine learning, and database systems. Here I explore the field of rule mining, where these techniques are utilized to identify logic-based rules that facilitate reasoning over existing data and infer potential missing information.

In my projects, I am investigating how both existing and novel approaches to rule mining can aid in identifying complex relationships within knowledge graphs.

### Data Quality

Data quality refers to the accuracy, consistency, and relevance of information for its intended use. It is considered high when it reliably represents real-world entities and supports effective decision-making. As data sources multiply, maintaining internal consistency becomes crucial, independent of external applications.

In my work, I am investigating whether fundamental concepts and techniques from relational databases can be adapted and applied to graph databases.
